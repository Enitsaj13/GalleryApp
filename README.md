Getting Started with PIXABAY Mobile App

To Run this App, just simply clone or click the download button.

git clone https://github.com/Enitsaj13/GalleryApp.git

After downloading or cloning the source code, go to its directory named "REACTNATIVETEST".

Type 'yarn' to download all the dependencies and node modules. If you don't have yet yarn packages, just simply type 'npm install --global yarn'.

Now, you can start testing the app by simply typing 'expo start' and follow the showing commands.

You can also open it through yarn by simply typing 'yarn ios' or 'yarn android'.

If you don't have a computer / laptop, you can also run it through expo go, by simply putting this url: exp://192.168.1.2:19000

Then viola, welcome to the PIXABAY APP. Enjoy!

Btw, if you want to change the API KEY, you can do it by going to the file named 'Home.jsx' under the screens directory and change the API_KEY value.
